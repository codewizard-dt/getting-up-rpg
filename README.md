# Getting up RPG

First run the project at https://getting-up-rpg.herokuapp.com/

# Project Description

This is a game created that emulates the trials and tribulations that we all face after waking up and trying to make it to class on time.
The user is first promted to enter and submit their username and select start to begin the game.
The user takes the avatar of a despaired ghost, controlled by the d-pad or the arrow keys on their keyboard, navigating through the different rooms.
They will be given 3 options to start, that each will effect the crisis level, preparedness, and time left, all factors determining whether or not the user is ready for the start of class.
Throughout the game the user will be faced with random dilemnas, choices and outcomes.

# Concept

With this project our team desired to create a game that took into account a range of disruptive possibilities from benign ever day realities to comically absurd improbabilities that could disrupt the shared experience of a morning routine. 

This game was partially born of an appreciation of existentalist philosophy and how it relates to individual experience. The Jean-Paul Sartre quote ", all human actions are equivalent and all are on principle doomed to failure" worked as a catalyst for the game design which relied heavily on themes of both chaos and the absurdism of possibility. 

In these difficult times it is our hope that "Getting up." acts as a humorous distraction from the oft ridiculousness of the human condition. 

# Future Development
With more time we would have liked a more polished UI
Better event triggers
