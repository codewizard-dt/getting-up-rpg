# Getting up RPG

First run the project at https://getting-up-rpg.herokuapp.com/

# Project Description

This is a game created that emulates the trials and tribulations that we all face after waking up and trying to make it to class on time.
The user is first promted to enter and submit their username and select start to begin the game.
The user takes the avatar of a despaired ghost, controlled by the d-pad or the arrow keys on their keyboard, navigating through the different rooms.
They will be given 3 options to start, that each will effect the crisis level, preparedness, and time left, all factors determining whether or not the user is ready for the start of class.
Throughout the game the user will be faced with random dilemnas, choices and outcomes.
